            Kisan Basket began with a simple mission: to bridge the gap between
            local farmers and urban consumers. We believe in providing fresh,
            quality produce while supporting our farming community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-[14px]  lg:text-[18px]">
            Our journey started in a small village market, where we recognized
            the need for a direct connection between farmers and consumers.
            Today, weâ€™re proud to serve thousands of customers across multiple
            cities, maintaining our commitment to quality and sustainability.
